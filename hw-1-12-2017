	5. cd ~
	8. cd 
	9. cd ..
These commands can be used by Amanda to navigate to her home directory

2. Relative Path Resolution
	ls ../backup displays original  pnas_final  pnas_sub

3. ls Reading Comprehension
	commands that will display reverse order are #2 and #3, ls -r -F      and   ls -r -F /Users/backup

4. Exploring More ls Arguments
ls -l: shows the file/directory names that are located, in addition with file size and date of last modification
ls -h: shows the files or folders that are located in the folder/directory

5.Listing Recursively and by time
the command ls -R -t lists the directories in alphabetical order at each level, the files and directories in each direcotry are listed by last modification time
