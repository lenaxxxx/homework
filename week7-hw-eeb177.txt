1) The following are valid R variable names:
min_height
max.height
MaxLength
celsius2kelvin

2) What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the following program?

mass <- 47.5 (variable of mass will be 47.5)
age <- 122 (variable of age will be 122)
mass <- mass * 2.3 (the mass of 47.5 will multiply 2.3 to give a new mass variable)
age <- age - 20 ( the age of 122 will be substracted by 20 and giving 102 as new age varibale)

3) Clean up your working environment by deleting the mass and age variables.
rm(age, mass)

4) Install the ggplot2 package
install.packages("ggplot2")
